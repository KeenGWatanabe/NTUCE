# Terraform Lock Files Explained

There are two types of lock files in Terraform that serve different purposes:

## 1. `.terraform.lock.hcl` - Dependency Lock File

This file is automatically generated by Terraform to:
- Record the exact provider versions used in your configuration
- Ensure consistent provider versions across your team
- Contains checksums for provider binaries to verify authenticity

When you see the Git warning about LF/CRLF, it's just informing you that Git will normalize the line endings in this file (which is fine).

## 2. State Lock File (Not a physical file)

This is a different concept - it's a mechanism to:
- Prevent concurrent operations on the same Terraform state
- Implemented via backend systems (like S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.)
- Appears as a temporary lock during operations
- Not a physical file you commit to version control

## Best Practices

1. **Commit `.terraform.lock.hcl`** to version control - it ensures team consistency
2. **Don't commit `.terraform/` directory** - this contains local cached providers
3. The LF/CRLF warning is harmless for the lock file
4. State locks are automatic and temporary - they resolve when operations complete

The warning you're seeing is just Git's standard line ending normalization and doesn't affect Terraform's functionality.
