What is needed to authorize your EC2 to retrieve secrets from the AWS Secret Manager?
Derive the IAM policy (i.e. JSON)?
Using the secret name prod/cart-service/credentials, derive a sensible ARN as the specific resource for access
To authorize your EC2 instance to retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager, you need to:

1. **Create an IAM Role**: Attach an IAM role to your EC2 instance that grants the necessary permissions to access Secrets Manager.

2. **Attach an IAM Policy**: Attach an IAM policy to the role that allows the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` action for the specific secret.

3. **Use the Correct ARN**: The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the secret should be in the format:
   ```
   arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:<secret-name>
   ```
   For the secret name `prod/cart-service/credentials`, the ARN would look like:
   ```
   arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:prod/cart-service/credentials
   ```

### Example IAM Policy
Hereâ€™s an example IAM policy in JSON format that grants access to retrieve the secret value for `prod/cart-service/credentials`:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:prod/cart-service/credentials"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Steps to Implement
1. Replace `<region>` with the AWS region where your secret is stored (e.g., `us-east-1`).
2. Replace `<account-id>` with your AWS account ID.
3. Attach this policy to the IAM role associated with your EC2 instance.

### Optional: Restrict Access Further
If you want to restrict access to only the specific version or stage of the secret, you can append the version ID or stage to the ARN. For example:
- For a specific version: `arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:prod/cart-service/credentials:<version-id>`
- For a specific stage: `arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:prod/cart-service/credentials:<stage>`

### Attach the Role to the EC2 Instance
1. Go to the EC2 console.
2. Select the instance.
3. Click **Actions > Security > Modify IAM Role**.
4. Attach the IAM role with the policy you created.

Now, your EC2 instance will have the necessary permissions to retrieve the secret from AWS Secrets Manager.
