# Execution Role on the Lambda Function:
IAM role in a Lambda function = the permissions that the function has when it executes.

the execution role must include the necessary permissions (e.g., s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject); to perform those actions.

# Purpose:
specifies what AWS resources the Lambda function can access; what actions it can perform (to read from or write to an S3 bucket);

# Resource-Based Policy on the Lambda Function:
done by adding a resource-based policy to the Lambda function that grants S3 the lambda:InvokeFunction permission.

# Purpose:
controls which AWS services or accounts are allowed to invoke the function. for S3-triggered Lambda function, S3 needs permission to invoke the Lambda function when a file is created in the bucket.

# If the Function Needs to Upload a File into an S3 Bucket:
If the Lambda function needs to upload a file into an S3 bucket, the following updates are required:

1. Update to the Execution Role:
The execution role must be updated to include permissions for uploading files to the S3 bucket. Specifically, the role needs the s3:PutObject permission for the target bucket (and optionally s3:ListBucket if the function needs to list objects in the bucket).
Example policy to add to the execution role:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:PutObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::target-bucket-name/*"
}
2. New Resource-Based Policy (if any):
No new resource-based policy is needed for the Lambda function to upload files to S3. The resource-based policy is only required to allow other services (like S3) to invoke the Lambda function. Since the upload operation is initiated by the Lambda function itself, the execution role's permissions are sufficient.

# Summary of Updates:
Execution Role Update:
Add s3:PutObject permission for the target bucket.
Resource-Based Policy Update:
No changes are needed unless the Lambda function is being invoked by a new service or account.
This setup ensures the Lambda function can both be triggered by S3 and upload files to another S3 bucket.
